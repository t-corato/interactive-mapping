# interactive-mapping
First project where I started working on building a Web Application, this project has the scope of creating a html web 
app in python using folium.

This app displays the volcanoes in the US and the population per country.
Clicking on a certain volcano on the html is possible to have data on it and, by clicking on the hyperlink with its 
name, look for the specific volcano on Google.
